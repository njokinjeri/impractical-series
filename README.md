# Impractical Series

**A delightfully unnecessary project collection.**

The Impractical Series is a collection of intentionally non-essential builds. Each project starts with a vague idea and evolves through experimentation, constraint, and occasional chaos.

I aim to preserve the original visual or conceptual intent I enthusiastically had as much as possible; regardless the project does offer room to pivot only when reality well pushes back. 


**Each project is designed to be both:**

- a learning environment for technical growth, and

- a creative outlet to test ideas that may feel premature, impractical, or “not yet reachable” at the time they’re built.

*Projects in this series are deliberately randomized. There is no roadmap. Curiosity paves the way.*


### Why “Impractical”?

Because not everything worth building needs a reason beyond *“I wondered what would happen if…”*

And well what's the point of wondering when you can just dive right in. 🔎
