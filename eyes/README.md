# Experiment

A playful interactive demo where two eyes follow your mouse pointer in real-time.

Features realistic pupils, subtle light glare, and blinking animations for a lifelike effect.

**Built with**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CSS variables are used to track the mouse position in real-time.

**How it works**: Each pupil calculates the angle between the eye center and your cursor, moving smoothly within the eye’s boundary to follow it.
